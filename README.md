### 🎉 New: Version 0.2a 🎉

⏳ Timeout → Now the bot has a timeout when no music is playing. It will disconnect after 1 minute to save memory.



🎵 Setup Channel Command → A dedicated music channel can now be set up to prevent flooding other chat channels. All non-music messages will be deleted.



📊 Polls → Create a simple poll where you can set the question, options (up to 10), and duration (in minutes). Users can vote using emojis ✅❌🔥.



🎁 Giveaways → Similar to polls, but users must react with an emoji 🎉 to enter. A minimum of two participants is required.


💾 Database → The bot now uses a database to store the music channel configuration and other future settings.



### 🛠️ Fixes & Improvements:

🚫 No more crashes! The bot no longer crashes when a Lavalink error occurs. It now handles various error messages without shutting down.


📩 Admin Alerts → If an error happens, the bot sends a message to the admin ⚠️, including server ID, error message, and timestamp for easier tracking and fixes.



✨ More exciting improvements are coming in the next update! Hopefully, Version 0.3 will bring enhancements rather than just fixes.



Thanks for your support! ❤️
